^ question for Creston

Flow for a student through the app:
1: Come to the home page
2: Click on the "login for my recommendations button"
3: Be directed to "your class board" page

Internally what needs to happen?
If a student clicks on login page, we receive their username.
1. Check if the username is in the database
2. If it is in the database, proceed with normal actions.
3. If the username is not in the database, then create a new student in
the database with empty attributes
    3.a. Redirect the student to a welcome page that asks them to input
    their name and their major
4. Retrieve the data associated with a username that is necessary for the
class board page, which would be the 'Classes' attribute. Render classes
page.
5. Send the student to their classboard page 
6. When a student clicks on any other tab, that page should load in the
data associated with the person's username; if there is no username,
throw error
