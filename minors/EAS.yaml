    Written work, which may be a senior thesis, a junior paper, or an independent research paper with an East Asian topical component.  
    
    The standard way to meet the requirement for independent work is by writing a senior thesis on an East Asian topic. "East Asian Topic" means the thesis is more than half about East Asia.
