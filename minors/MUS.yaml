code: MUS
degree:
description: The minor in the Department of Music invites students to 
  explore a diverse range of fields of study, from composition and 
  electronic music, to musicology, theory, sound studies, music 
  cognition, jazz studies and more. Students pursue work in two loosely 
  defined areas; Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making 
  (M&M). M&M encompasses topics usually explored in hands-on, 
  exploratory ways, such as composition, improvisation, theory, analysis 
  and electronic music. The C&C area focuses on the scholarly study of 
  music, from historical and formalist analysis to cognitive science and 
  ethnography. While independent work is not required, there are options 
  for students interested in pursuing private lessons (in composition 
  and electronic music), studies in music cognition (through the Music 
  Cognition Lab), research projects with faculty, or the Music 
  Mentorship program that pairs music undergraduates with graduate 
  students.

  explanation: Two additional MUS courses. By petition to the DUS, one 
    of these electives can be outside MUS, though must reflect a 
    coherent plan of study (for instance, a particular psychology 
    course in support of a plan of study focusing on music cognition).
