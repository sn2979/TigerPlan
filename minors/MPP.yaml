code: MPP
degree:
description: The minor in Music Performance is a rigorous opportunity 
  for students to study the performance of vocal and instrumental music 
  (both jazz and classical) or conducting in the context of a liberal 
  arts education. It provides extensive opportunities for students to 
  hone their skills through participation in department ensembles, 
  recitals, studio instruction and performance classes, and also 
  requires coursework in the Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials 
  and Making (M&M) distribution areas. The MPP minor provides a solid 
  foundation for students who may wish to pursue professional music 
  training at the graduate level.

  explanation: One additional MPP or MUS elective, chosen in 
    consultation with relevant program director. By petition to the 
    relevant program director, one of these electives can be outside 
    MUS, though must reflect a coherent plan of study (i.e., a 
    particular African American studies course in support of a plan of 
    study focusing on Jazz Performance).

- name: Ensemble Participation
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Ensemble participation in an approved faculty-led Music Department Ensemble is required in all four semesters of the junior and senior years. 
    
    The specific ensemble must be for the instrument and performance tradition for which the student was admitted. For cases in which the department does not offer a faculty-led ensemble for the instrument (e.g., classical piano, classical guitar, conducting), students may audition for a different faculty-led ensemble to fulfill the MPP minor ensemble participation requirement, or may pursue equivalent collaborative assignments as detailed on the Music Department website.
- name: Studio Lessons
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Studio lessons are required and must be taken with a Department of Music studio instructor or, if applicable, a program director. 
    
    More specific parameters will differ depending on the instrument/performance practice for which the student is admitted. Students will have the option to enroll in lessons for credit (MPP298/299) if they want their work in lessons to be specifically reflected on their transcript. Students who choose to do so may NOT count this course toward completion of MPP course requirements.

  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    A recital or related program-specific performance is required in senior year, which would be a demonstration of core study with the program approved by both applicable studio instructor and relevant program director.
