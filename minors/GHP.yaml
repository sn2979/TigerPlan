  explanation: Students take two core GHP courses together as a cohort 
    during their junior year. Exceptions to the core courses being taken 
    during the junior year can be made when a student will be studying 
    abroad, is on a leave of absence or will otherwise be off-campus; 
    or when a student has a timing conflict with a required 
    concentration course.

  explanation: Students must take four additional elective courses in 
    global health. Students may choose from an elective list that is 
    curated and approved in advance every semester by the minor.
    Elective courses may be at the 200-, 300-, or 400-level.
    A student may count a maximum of two 200-level courses toward the 
    four elective total. If a cross-listed course carries both a 200- 
    and 300-level course number, it will count as a 200-level course for 
    purposes of this requirement.
    One course taken off-campus, including study abroad courses, may be 
    taken as an elective with prior minor approval.

    GHP students will write a senior thesis or research paper that addresses or relates to global health in an interdisciplinary manner. 
    
    The requirement can be fulfilled in three ways, including a departmental thesis that fully integrates a global health topic; a final chapter added to a technical or lab-based thesis that connects the preceding content to a global health topic; or an original research paper on a global health topic.

  explanation: |-
    GHP students will complete an internship or research experience during the summer between junior and senior year. This provides students an opportunity to apply concepts from the core GHP courses and any electives taken to date in a real-world context. 
    
    This experience must be full-time and must be a minimum of eight weeks in duration. The internship may be remote. All internships must be approved in advance by the minor.

    Applicants should also have maintained a cumulative 3.0 GPA through the time of application. 
    
    Students with a cumulative GPA below 3.0, or who have not completed both prerequisite courses, may still apply to the minor during the sophomore spring with an explanation of any extenuating circumstances.
    
    One elective may be taken in the first year or sophomore year. Three of the four electives must be taken in junior or senior year.
