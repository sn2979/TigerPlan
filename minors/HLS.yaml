description: The minor in Hellenic Studies (HLS) aims to provide 
  students with a thorough introduction to the history, literature, and 
  culture of the Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean over the past 
  three thousand years. This minor will allow students to engage, from a 
  variety of disciplinary perspectives, with all aspects of Hellenism, 
  its global encounters, and cross-cultural dialogues. At the same time, 
  students in the Hellenic studies minor will acquire a strong grounding 
  in the long history of this important region of the world.
