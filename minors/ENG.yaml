description: In the Department of English students are trained 
  to read critically and to attend to the imbricated histories of 
  language, literature, culture, and power. Students read widely 
  across genres and periods of British, American, and Anglophone 
  literature as well as across a variety of critical and theoretical 
  approaches. In addition to lectures and seminars devoted to poetry, 
  prose, and drama, English offers courses on cinema, photography, 
  architecture, the public essay, and data and culture, among other 
  media and topics. We encourage students to think across disciplines 
  and languages, and we offer vital skills and resources that support 
  independent research.

  explanation: Five courses, at least two of them seminars. Just as 
    there are no prerequisites, there are also no required courses for 
    the minor. The department will offer suggestions as to possible 
    clusters but we will also invite students to chart their own paths 
    and propose a new cluster.
