description: The minor in humanistic studies is open to students
  from all majors who wish to pursue their intellectual interests
  and commitments within an interdisciplinary curriculum. HUM
  minors are encouraged to reflect on the presuppositions of
  their major field and to become versatile thinkers and
  researchers. Some HUM minors prefer to connect disciplines
  across and within the scholarly humanities (e.g., literature
  with philosophy); others are drawn to connect the humanities
  to the creative arts, engineering, or social or natural sciences.
  Still others engage with such interdisciplinary fields of study
  as medical, environmental, urban and digital humanities.

# Notes: change structure after we know that double counting works
# At least two of the four courses must be HUM courses, originating in
# the Program in Humanistic Studies. Two of the four courses
#    must be taken at the 300 or 400 level.
