description: For more than 30 years, the Program in Environmental 
  Studies (ENV), now based in the High Meadows Environmental Institute 
  (HMEI), has aimed to equip Princeton students with the skills to 
  address critical environmental challenges that they will face 
  throughout their careers and in life. Our guiding ethos is grounded in 
  the appreciation that environmental challenges — both present and 
  future — cannot be solved by any one discipline alone, but require 
  concerted, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts, spanning 
  all four divisions of the university. To that end, the program is 
  designed to attract students from all disciplinary backgrounds and 
  with varied interests, and to allow them to tailor their learning 
  while also ensuring that they are exposed to fundamental environmental 
  questions and methods/approaches through a variety of complementary 
  lenses.

  explanation: |-
    Students must investigate an environmental topic as a component of their independent work, which can take one of four forms:

    1. a substantial part (e.g., a chapter) of a senior thesis.
    2. a junior paper submitted to fulfill departmental requirement; supervising faculty needs to attest to its ENV focus.
    3. a 15–20-page final report based on work done (at any stage of undergrad career) during an HMEI internship supervised by a University faculty member. The supervising faculty must review and sign off on the paper as being of sufficient quality to satisfy an independent paper requirement (e.g., a JP).
    4. a 15–20-page independent paper supervised and approved by an HMEI or HMEI-affiliated faculty.

    Two of the total five courses must be in humanities and/or social sciences and two must be in natural sciences and engineering.
    
    No more than one course filling the requirement for the ENV minor may also be counted toward the student’s departmental concentration or another minor/certificate.
