description: The Program in Medieval Studies encourages the 
  interdisciplinary study of the Middle Ages; its art, literature (Latin 
  and vernacular), music, religion, science, philosophy, politics, and 
  economic and social structures. Supported by the vast resources for 
  medieval studies at Princeton (including an outstanding medieval 
  manuscript collection and the photographic archive known as the Index 
  of Medieval Art), the program sponsors one course; an introductory 
  seminar, and a (noncredit) thesis writers' colloquium for seniors. 
  Other courses directly relevant to medieval studies are listed under 
  the courses section.

    explanation: |-
      One larger final project on a relevant topic completed in the senior year, amounting to the equivalent of one thesis chapter or more. 
      
      Project forms include a departmental senior thesis, a substantive data-based project on primary sources and materials, internships that require intensive work with primary sources. Please discuss the range of possibilities (and Princeton’s own opportunities) with the director. 
      
      In the senior thesis colloquium, taught by the director of the program, these projects, activities, experiences and expertise will be regularly presented and discussed during senior year.
