description: The program emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the 
  study of materials and the engineering application of their 
  properties. The program is designed primarily for students in science 
  and engineering departments who are considering careers in materials, 
  or have general interest in materials science and engineering, 
  although students from other disciplines, with appropriate background, 
  may join. Participants in the program will take courses in their own 
  department together with a group of materials courses chosen from a 
  selected list offered by the participating departments and/or the 
  Princeton Materials Institute. Satisfactory completion of the program 
  is recognized by the award of a minor in materials science and 
  engineering upon graduation.
