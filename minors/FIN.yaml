    As economic theory, mathematics, and probability and statistics are
    pervasive in modern financial analysis, completion of the finance 
    minor requires mathematical ability and preparation. The following 
    foundation courses are required for admission into the program and 
    (except as noted) must be completed by the end of sophomore year. 
    All courses require a letter grade (pass/D/fail not allowed). 
    Students are required to take courses in mathematics, economics
    and probability and statistics as specified below.

      MAT 201 and MAT 202 are both strongly recommended, though only
      the higher of the two grades is recorded for the purpose of 
      fulfilling the entry requirements. Students who choose to fulfill
      this requirement by taking the one-semester MAT 175 will be 
      responsible for mastering the linear algebra part of the 
      curriculum on their own.
