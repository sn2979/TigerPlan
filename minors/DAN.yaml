description: The Program in Dance, part of the Lewis Center for the 
  Arts, welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At 
  the core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an 
  integration of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to 
  ourselves and our communities. To that end, the dance minor offers 
  students deep exposure to and appreciation of dance through practice, 
  performance and critical conversation.

  explanation: |-
    There are pathways for all students regardless of previous exposure
    to and experience in dance. Students interested in pursuing a minor
    in dance should enroll in a minimum of two DAN courses in their
    first and second years.

    Students taking their first dance class or
    expanding their experience in new directions are encouraged to
    participate in two 200-level courses, such as DAN 213 Introduction
    to Contemporary Dance; DAN 222 Introduction to Hip-Hop Dance; 
    DAN 225 Introduction to Breaking: Deciphering Its Power; 
    DAN 211 The American Experience and Dance Practices of the African
    Diaspora; DAN 221 Stillness; or DAN 208 Body and Language.

    For those entering Princeton with previous dance experience
    performing and choreographing, we recommend  participation in 300-
    or 400-level courses, such as Dance Performance Workshop courses
    (319, 320 or 419) in the fall and a spring studio course, such as
    DAN 432 Ballet as an Evolving Form, DAN 408 Approaches to 
    Contemporary Dance (or DAN 401, 402, 431), as these provide 
    prospective minors with rigorous, in-depth study of specific forms
    and methods.
