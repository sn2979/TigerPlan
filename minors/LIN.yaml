description:
  Students at Princeton develop the skills of a linguist through 
  hands-on engagement with gathering and interpreting data from many 
  different languages, the employment of diverse methodologies, and the 
  investigation of language through a variety of lenses, including;
  
  1. Working with native speakers of an unfamiliar language (Field 
  Methods).
  2. Engaging with descriptive grammars and large-scale statistical 
  correlations to investigate similarities and differences across 
  languages (Linguistic Typology).
  3. Analyzing texts to elucidate how language changes over time 
  (Historical Linguistics).
  4. Modeling linguistic differences across dialects and social contexts 
  (Sociolinguistics).
  5. Measuring linguistic behaviors in controlled experimental contexts 
  (Psycholinguistics).
  6. Observing how languages develop/coexist within speakers (Language 
  Acquisition, Bilingualism).

      or above (which may be drawn from the sets above). 
      Linguistics-related courses in other departments and programs 
      that do not have the LIN designation may be approved by the 
      director of undergraduate program on a case-by-case basis. No 
      more than one of these elective courses may be taken 
      pass/D/fail.

  explanation: |-
    Some substantial aspect of linguistics should be incorporated either into the student’s junior independent work or into their senior thesis. 
    
    This requirement is typically met either by writing a junior paper or senior thesis on a linguistics topic or topic related to linguistics (i.e., a topic that satisfies the requirements of both the student’s major and minor), or by including a chapter on a linguistics topic in a senior thesis whose general topic is not directly related to linguistics. 
    
    If this is not feasible, students should contact the director of undergraduate program for alternative arrangements, which in most cases will involve writing a short piece of independent work on a topic related to linguistics, supervised by a member of the LIN faculty.
